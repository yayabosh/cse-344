It was pretty cool that we could use a cloud hosted DBMS.
But we only got to see the query editor, which was cool and all
but was essentially the same thing as we did in hw2 so the change
in workspace wasn't really noticed by me. However, if working with a
really large database, I would definitely recommend it for students.
If working on a smaller database, I think SQLite gets the job done
perfectly!

I think if we get to use Azure in future projects I'd definitely 
like it though, the experience we get from working with a large scale
database that is used in the industry is super cool.
